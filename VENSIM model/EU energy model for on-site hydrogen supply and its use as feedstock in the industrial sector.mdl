Although the model is a simulation model, a hybrid approach with optimisation is possible. In such optimisation, it is possible to minimise the total cumulative emissions with the minimum electrolytic power required (electrolyser installation policy from a resource and pollutant gas sustainable point of view). See ‘optimisation guidelines’ view for more information.
